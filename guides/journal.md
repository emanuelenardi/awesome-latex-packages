- :octocat: [calliope](https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope) â€” Simple script for journal writing using LaTeX

- [`tasks`](https://ctan.org/pkg/tasks) â€” the reaÂ­son for the creÂ­ation of the `tasks` enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment was an unÂ­writÂ­ten agreeÂ­ment in GerÂ­man maths textÂ­books (exspeÂ­cially (juÂ­nior) high school textÂ­books) to orÂ­gaÂ­nize exÂ­erÂ­cises in columns countÂ­ing horÂ­iÂ­zonÂ­tally rather than verÂ­tiÂ­cally

- [`typed-checklist`](https://ctan.org/pkg/typed-checklist) â€” it proÂ­vide means for typeÂ­setÂ­ting checkÂ­lists in a way that stipÂ­uÂ­lates users to exÂ­plicÂ­itly disÂ­tinÂ­guish checkÂ­lists for goals, for tasks, for arÂ­tiÂ­facts, and for mileÂ­stones. The inÂ­tenÂ­tion beÂ­hind this is that a user of the packÂ­age is coÂ­erced to think about what kind of enÂ­tries he/she adds to the checkÂ­list. This shall yield a clearer reÂ­sult and, in the long run, help with trainÂ­ing to disÂ­tinÂ­guish enÂ­tries of difÂ­ferÂ­ent types.
